            <h2> about me! </h2>
                <p>i am born and raised in vancouver, bc!</p>
                <p>i am <strong>6 ft 1</strong> and utilize my height in my favourite hobby, <strong>volleyball!</strong></p>
                <p>when i am not playing volleyball, i am either watching hockey or slaving away at my courses at BCIT.</p>
                <p>what inspired me to attend BCIT was purely based off the fact that i have a few friends in the program who told me <em>"the program is better than retail."</em></p>
